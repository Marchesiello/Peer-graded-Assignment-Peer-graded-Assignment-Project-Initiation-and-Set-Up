New Hire Orientation program - Innovations Inc.

Scenario: New Hire Orientation program

Innovations Inc. is a company that features office interior decorating and renovation solutions. The organization has been in business for more than 20 years, with an annual sales exceeding $12M. The organization have over 300 employees in the three-state area of the United States of America.
Recently, Innovations Inc. is seeing an increase in employee attrition when compared with the past years. During the exit surveys, a primary complaint from employees has been the lack of an effective orientation program and lack of corporate support.
After analysis, the Innovations Inc. HR has found that approximately 4% of new employees quit within their first week of employment, and approximately 20% left within 45 days of hire. The statistics map to the trends seen across the industry. This supported recent industry reports that stated 4% of all employees leave the job on the first day, and 22% leave within 45 days. Sadly, Innovations Inc. spends at least $6000 to recruit a new employee.
In an attempt to reduce attrition rates, the HR team at Innovations Inc. is initiating a project to develop a New Hire Orientation program. Marcus Wilson, the Head of HR at Innovations Inc., will sponsor the project. He will devote two hours per week to the project. Gloria Fisher is the newly assigned project manager. She will devote 20 hours a week to the project. Marcus wants the costs to be reasonable. However, if needed, the senior management at Innovations Inc. is ready to invest what it takes to make the program a success. The team has about 14 weeks before the first orientation event to develop the New Hire Orientation program.
The New Hire Orientation program will be run quarterly. The first formal orientation is scheduled for 1-2 June. It is currently 15 February. Project initiation must begin immediately to complete the development on time and be ready for the 1 June kick-off. The June date is firm and cannot be adjusted. All follow-up activities must be completed by 20 June.
Marcus estimates that approximately 12 new employees will participate in the New Hire Orientation program each quarter. An additional 8 individuals from Innovations Inc. will participate fully. The project will be funded for program development and all direct costs associated with the 1 June inaugural event. After that, the New Hire Orientation program will be funded through HR operations.
This project includes planning and developing the program and implementing the initial orientation.
